 * to your implementation (if you have any). Then, tell the #CameraFilesystem
 * (available in #camera->fs) how to retrieve lists
 * (gp_filesystem_set_list_funcs()), how to retrieve or set file information
 * (gp_filesystem_set_info_funcs()), how to get or delete files
 * (gp_filesystem_set_file_funcs()), or how to put files or delete all files
 * in a folder (#gp_filesystem_set_folder_funcs). After that, configure
 * the port (#camera->port) which is already opened by gphoto2. You just have
 * to call gp_port_settings_get(), adjust the settings, call
 * gp_port_settings_set(), and try to write to and read from the port.
 * If the camera responds, return #GP_OK. If not, return some
 * meaningful error code.
