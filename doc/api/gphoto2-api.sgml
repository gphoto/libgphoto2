    <title>GPhoto2 Overview</title>
    <para>
GPhoto2 is a library for accessing a wide range of digital cameras.
It works on many UNIX-like platforms. GPhoto2 is released under the GNU
Library General Public License (GNU LGPL), which allows for flexible 
licensing of client applications. GPhoto2 is written entirely in C and 
has an object-oriented architecture that makes it easy for other 
programming languages to access GPhoto2.
    </para>
    <para>
GPhoto2 doesn't depend on any external library. However, it is 
strongly recommended that you have some library installed that handles
locking of serial ports. GPhoto2 currently supports

    <title>GPhoto2 Utilities</title>
    <para>
      GPhoto2's core provides some utility functions and general 
      datatypes. In contrast to the
      objects presented later, they
      cannot be classified as objects, and are therefore presented upfront.

    <title>GPhoto2 Objects</title>

      In order to simplify programming with GPhoto2, an object oriented
      approach has been used. The different objects are presented in
      the following sections.
