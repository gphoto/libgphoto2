    <title>GPhoto2 Overview</title>
    <para>
GPhoto2 is a library for accessing a wide range of digital cameras.
It works on many UNIX-like platforms. GPhoto2 is released under the GNU
Library General Public License (GNU LGPL), which allows for flexible 
licensing of client applications. GPhoto2 is written entirely in C and 
has an object-oriented architecture that makes it easy for other 
programming languages to access GPhoto2.
    </para>
    <para>
GPhoto2 doesn't depend on any external library. However, it is 
strongly recommended that you have some library installed that handles
locking of serial ports. GPhoto2 currently supports

    <title>GPhoto2 Utilities</title>
    <para>
      GPhoto2's core provides some utility functions and general 
      datatypes. In contrast to the
      objects presented later, they
      cannot be classified as objects, and are therefore presented upfront.

      In order to simplify programming with GPhoto2, an object oriented
      approach has been used. The different objects are presented in
