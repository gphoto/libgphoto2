# This file describes how to install libgphoto2.
########################################################################

Follow these steps to build and install libgphoto2 from the source
code. You don't have to run most of these steps as root, except when
explicitly required. In fact, you really shouldn't.

In order to get libgphoto2 running after installation, you will
probably want to read The gPhoto2 Manual. It is available from the
homepage:

    http://gphoto.net/
    http://gphoto.org/
    http://gphoto.com/
    http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/

At lease one of these should work at any time.


===============================
Step 0: Preparing configuration
===============================

If you got your copy of gphoto2 packaged as a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 tarball, 
SKIP THIS STEP. 

If you got libgphoto2 from CVS, then you will have to prepare for step 1,
the configuration of the sources.

For that, we supply you with a script called 'autogen.sh'. It calls
several tools in a certain sequence. For autogen.sh to work, you
require the following tools

	automake
	autoconf
	gettext
	libtool

in versions compatible to each other and to libgphoto2. Most
combinations on current GNU/Linux systems work, whereas BSD systems
tend to have some compatibility problems.


=============================
Step 1: Configure the sources
=============================

Now run either one of


  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

     to prepare a tarball source tree for installation in (e.g.) /usr/local


  ./configure --prefix=/home/me/root --with-drivers=ptp,canon

       to prepare a tarball source tree for installation in
       /home/me/root and for compilation only of the drivers 
       for PTP and Canon cameras

or run ./configure --help in order to find out about more
configuration parameters.

See Appendix A at the end of this file for some hints on configuring
for certain platforms.

The following software components are optional, and will improve the
libraries' and/or command-line client's functionality if present:

	libusb (ver. >= 0.1.6a) -- Universal Serial Bus camera support
	    <URL:http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/>

	gettext (ver. >= 0.10.40) -- internationalization using shared library

	gtk-doc -- documentation built in doc/api/

	libexif - EXIF tag support
	    <URL:http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif>

Please check the output of the configure script for whether all
desired libraries have been detected correctly. E.g., you might
have to add the path where libusb-config resides to your PATH
before running configure.


===========================
Step 2: Compile the program
===========================

You will probably be best off running GNU make. On GNU/Linux linux
systems, you can run "make", on other systems (such as *BSD), you
will have to run "gmake" or something similar.

The classic way to compile the program is just to run

    make

and wait until the source is built.


==============================
Step 3: Installing the program
==============================

To install the stuff you just compiled by running "make", you can just
run 

   make install

now. If installing to a directory which is not writable by your
current user, you will have to run it as root.

This installs the software and documentation into the proper
directories on your system.


====================================================
Step 4: Installation is finished - now what do I do?
====================================================

Note that libgphoto2 is not designed to be run by a setuid/setgid
program. Running ANY libgphoto2 frontend as root or setuid root or in
a similar fashion will open up a SECURITY HOLE in your system!

If you run into problems, please read the FAQ (at the website) first.

For more general information about how to configure libgphoto2, read
The gPhoto2 Manual (at the website).

If you have permission problems when accessing your camera, read
the chapter on Permission Setup -- you will probably want to create a
new user group for the users that are to have camera access and change
the permissions of the serial or USB device to match.


===============================================
Appendix A: Platform specific compilation hints
===============================================

libgphoto2 has been successfully used on many system.  Some systems
where it has been reported to successfully compile are listed
below. Not all, or even any, camera libraries have been tested on
these systems, so there may be endian other other issues that prevent
some camera libraries from working.

Please report any changes to this list to the gphoto developer mailing
list.  As of this writing, USB support is only available on Linux and
FreeBSD as those are the only systems on which libusb is available.

General Hints:

  - If you have build problems in the intl or po directories, try
    re-running configure with the --disable-nls flag.
  - If configure stops due to an error with 'test', try re-running
    configure with the --without-usb flag.  
  - If 'make' reports an error, try using GNU make (often called gmake
    or gnumake) instead of the make that comes with your system.
  - If one camera driver has compilation errors, re-run configure with
    an appropriate --with-drivers= flag to prevent that driver from
    being compiled.

The list of working systems is a little outdated as of 2002-11-20, but
we have still left it here as a reference.

i386:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Red Hat Linux 7.1
  Red Hat Linux 4.2
  TurboLinux 6.5
  Slackware Linux 8.0
  FreeBSD 4.3
	Try the following to configure the optional libraries:
	  env CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
	  LDFLAGS="-I/usr/local/lib" ./configure
	(you may also need to append the flag --disable-nls).
	Use GNU make to build (gmake).

Alpha:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  OpenBSD 3.0
  NetBSD 1.5.1
  	Configure with this command:
  	  ./configure --disable-nls
	Use GNU make to build (gmake).
  Tru64 5.1A

  	  env CFLAGS='-D__STDC_VERSION__=0' ./configure --disable-nls
	Use GNU make to build (gnumake).

PowerPC:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Apple Darwin/OS X
  	Need dlcompat from <URL:http://fink.sourceforge.net>
  	Configure with this command:
  	  env CFLAGS="-I/path/to/dlcompat -no-cpp-precomp" \
  	  LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/dlcompat" ./configure --disable-nls
	Need libtool ver. >= 1.4.2a

Sparc:
  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
  Solaris 8 (gcc)
  	Configure with this command:
  		./configure --without-usb
	and use GNU make to build (gmake).

StrongARM:
  Intimate+Debian iPAQ GNU/Linux (native gcc)
  Linux (cross-compiled gcc)

Itanium:
  Red Hat Linux 7.1 (gcc)


The following systems have some problems compiling, but may be made to
work with some effort:

Itanium:
  Red Hat Linux 7.1 (Intel ecc)
  	There is a bug in ver. 5.0.1 of this compiler tickled by gphoto2 that
  	prevents full compilation.
  	Need better libtool support (newer than version 1.4.2).
  Red Hat Linux 7.1 (sgicc)
  	Need better libtool support (newer than version 1.4.2).

Sparc:
  Solaris 8 (cc)
  	Sun's cc doesn't support #warning or # or ## macro features, which
  	occur several times in the code.

MIPS:
  IRIX (cc)
    MIPSpro C doesn't support #warning.


Thanks go to SourceForge for their compile farm, and Compaq for their
TestDrive program which allowed gphoto2 to be tested on many of these
systems.
