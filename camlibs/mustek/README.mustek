Driver for Mustek MDC 800 cameras by Henning Zabel <henning@uni-paderborn.de>

The driver supports the rs232 and the USB interface of the
Mustek MDC800 Digital Camera. It implements all function
to download pictures, view their thumbnails or delete them.
It is also possible to take photos with the library.
In the GUI of this driver you can select some preferences 
for this.

On rs232 it is possible to use every supported Baudrate. The
Baudrate is selectable in the GUI.

History :

10.01.2000 The Library was ported to the ne iolib. It uses also
           the USB Interface from Johannes Erdfeld. This makes it
			  unnecessary to have a special Kernelmodul for the 
			  Mustek.
			  In camera.h there is added a new entry, so you can select
			  whether you want to use USB or rs232. This is needed
			  because the iolib does not support autodetection for this.

19.11.1999 Autoprobe of the Baudrate when starting (opening) this
           driver was added. This makes it possible to reopen the
			  camera after an error, when the camera has been set
			  to another baudrate than 57k.
			  Automatic command retry has moved from rs232 to io, now
			  it also touches usb.

17.11.1999 Rewrite of the GUI: Some useless Function where deleted.
           The GUI now uses ComboBoxes.
			  Added support to select Baudrate of the camera in the GUI.

07.11.1999 This lib was posted to gphoto, after adapting the GUI
           from the earlier driver.
