<h1>
Reverse Engineering the JD11 - A drama in n chapters</h1>

<hr>
<h2>
What is the JD11?</h2>
The JD11 is a cheap digital camera produced by JenOptik (apparently a subsidiary
of Zeiss Jena). It was at the time of writing this available for around
250 DM.
<p>There is software available, a windows program called <i>FotoBee</i>
which is a huge heap of MFC dung. It can be made to run with a small hack
under the free Windows Emulator <a href="http://winehq.com">WINE</a>.
<p>WINE was crucial in reverse engineering the camera at all stages of
the project.
<h2>
Chapter 1:The lowlevel serial protocol</h2>
The JD11 comes with a serial cable with a DB9 connector on the computerside
and a small klinkenstecker at the camera end. So just 2 lines (RX, TX)
and GND.
<p>There is no documentation on the serial protocol in the inlaying documentation.
<p>The FotoBee.exe program uses the Windows serial communications interface,
which is fortunately implemented in WINE. By snooping the setup calls,
the serial parameters are:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 115200 Baud, no parity, 1 stopbit, 8 bit data, no flow control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (neither crtscts, nor XON/XOFF)</pre>
It also setting some large timeouts, since the camera sometimes needs like
2 seconds to think about something.
<p>That was rather trivial.
<h2>
Chapter 2: The serial data transfer protocol</h2>
The next step was to find out how the FotoBee software talks to the camera.
<p>&nbsp;Luckily the program still uses the standard Win32 serial communication
functions for that, so I added some code to the <tt>ReadFile</tt> and
<tt>WriteFile</tt>
functions, which dumps the read/written buffer if it is writing to a serial
device.
<p>In general, the program sends a command down the serial line (with optional
arguments) and receives data back. Every command starts with a <tt>0xFF</tt>
character.

Following commands can be used on toplevel:
<ul>
<li>PING
<li>FLOAT FACTORS
<li>SELECT INDEX
<li>SELECT IMAGE
<li>...
</ul>
For reading the INDEX picture following sequence appears:
<ul>
<li>SELECT INDEX
<li>IMAGE SIZE
<li>READ PACKET until packets exhausted.
</ul>
For reading the IMAGE picture following sequence appears:
<ul>
<li>SELECT IMAGE <i>n</i>
<li>Do 3 times:
<ul>
	<li>IMAGE SIZE
	<li>READ PACKET until packets exhausted.
</ul>
</ul>
That's all we needed to know about the serial commands.

<h2>Chapter 3: The image compression, stage 1</h2>

Judging from other cameras it is easy to suspect the camera uses the JPEG
format. It does not unfortunately.

<h3>Chapter 3.1: The format of the index picture</h3>
Casting a closer look at the raw data of the index picture shows a stream
of 8 bit values. Some experimentation later it turns out to a stream of
64x48 grayscale pictures, upside down.
Using:<pre>
	rawtopgm &lt;index 64 (sizeof_index/64) |pnmflip -tb &gt; index.ppm
</pre>
we can convert it into a .PPM and convert it further using standard UNIX tools.
<p>

The size of the index picture also tells us the number of pictures that are
currently stored in the camera. Just divide the size of the indeximage by 64*48.

<h3>Chapter 3.2: The low quality compressed image format</h3>
	The camera has two modes to store pictures, either in low or
	high quality. This is marked by the letters "L" and "H" on the
	cameras LCD. Default is the low quality format.<p>
	It is still unclear to me how to detect high/low quality formats,
	except with the size of the returned image.

<p>
At first look the data returned from the camera looks like junknoise. So I had
to peek into the diassembly, which shows a slightly inefficient huffman decompressor, with following bitpatterns:
<table border>
<tr><td>Bits</td><td>Value</td></tr>
<tr><td>00</td>			<td>-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>01</td>			<td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td>			<td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td>		<td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>1110</td>		<td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 0</td>		<td>-11</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 10</td>		<td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 110</td>		<td>-20</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 1110</td>		<td>45</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 1111 0</td>	<td>-45</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 1111 10</td>	<td>90</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 1111 110</td>	<td>-90</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 1111 1110</td>	<td>180</td></tr>
<tr><td>1111 1111 1111 0</td>	<td>-180</td></tr>
</table>
The result of this decompression run is 320*480 bytes for the first image,
and 320*240 for the second and third image. But these are not the pixel values,
these are differences!
<br>
So I had another look. Pixels are 8bit unsigned values and computed like this:
<ul>
<li>In the first row of the image: <code>pixel[i] = lastpixel+decompressed_diff;</code><br>
    The first pixel is based on 0.
<li>In all other rows (starting lastvalue is pixel[0] of the previous line):
<ul>
    <li><code>newpixelvalue = lastvalue + decompressed_diff;</code><br>
    <li><code>lastvalue = newpixelvalue*0.5 + pixel_lastline[i+1]*0.5;</code>
    <pre>
    		0 X 0
		X N 0
    </pre>
    The 'X' pixels influence the 'N' pixel (together with the uncompressed diff)
</ul>
</ul>
Tada. We now have 3 uncompressed images. To view each of them we can use:
<pre>
	rawtopgm 320 480 &lt;image0 | pnmflip -tb &gt; image0.ppm
	rawtopgm 320 240 &lt;image1 | pnmflip -tb &gt; image1.ppm
	rawtopgm 320 240 &lt;image2 | pnmflip -tb &gt; image2.ppm
</pre>
where image0 is the first image read, and image1,image2 the next two images.<p>
Both give pretty grayscale pictures, but are not yet in color.

<h3>Chapter 3.2: The high quality compressed image format</h3>
The high quality format uses a very different compression.<p>
It just compacts all 8bit values to 6bit by shortening out the 2 least
significant bits.
So we just restore them (AAAA AABB BBBB CCCC CCDD DDDD -&gt; AAAAAA00, BBBBBB00,
CCCCCC00, DDDDDD00) and get the same grayscale images as with the lowquality
compression.

<h3>Chapter 3.3: Getting colors</h3>
Now we have the green, the red and the blue components, with the green having
twice as much rows as the others.<br>
We can apply the bayer algorithm now and get the final 640x480 image.
