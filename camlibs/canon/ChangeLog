2010-05-05  Sven Killig  <sven@killig.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h, library.c:
	  - added shooting mode
	  - added ISO 50
	  - converted zoom level to GP_WIDGET_RANGE

2009-07-28  Axel Waggershauser  <awagger@web.de>

	* canon.c,canon.h,library.c,usb.c: Unified all configuration
	  names and values. Added /actions and /status sub configuration
 	  for actions and read-only variables.
	* canon.c,library.c: Fixed integer overflow in storage size detection.

2008-07-10  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c: Also handle IXUS 500 in the ptp2 driver only.
	* canon.c: Review all shared ids and handle them in the PTP driver.

2008-05-16  Moreno Marzolla  <moreno.marzolla@pd.infn.it>

	* canon.c, library.c: Added beep and zoom configurations.

	* canon.c, library.c: Enable remote mode once in a session and
	  close it in camera_exit.


2008-05-12  Moreno Marzolla  <moreno.marzolla@pd.infn.it>

	* canon.c, canon.h, README.canon: Added some more configuration
	  options.
 
2008-03-30  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c: SL_THUMB_CR2 should be as large as the CR2 image,
	  because the thumbnail getter retrieves the whole image for some reason.

	* canon.c: Moved strncpy() out of the failure node, making
	  replace_filename_extension() and filename_to_audio() work again.

2007-12-27  Daniel M German <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* canon.h, library.c: More configuration values for some
	  newer cameras / objectives.

2007-11-06  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* usb.c: Bumped timeout to 175.

2007-09-02  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c: Handle IXUS 30 also in ptp driver.

2007-06-03  Paul Walmsley  <paul@booyaka.com>

	* usb.c: remove one last CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_SECONDARY_IMAGE ifdef

2007-06-02  Paul Walmsley  <paul@booyaka.com>

	* usb.c: replace gp_port_usb_check_int_fast() calls with
	timeout save/change/restore and gp_port_usb_check_int()

2007-05-29  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* library.c, canon.c, canon.h,Makefile-files:
	  Removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_20D define, now default included.
	  Removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_SECONDARY_IMAGE and CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_SET_RELEASE_PARAMS
	  ifdefs, now also default included.

2007-05-25  Paul Walmsley <paul@booyaka.com>

	* usb.c: fix canon_usb_get_body_id() and caller to handle body IDs
	  > INT32_MAX (as seen in some recent Canon EOS 5D bodies)

	* canon.h: add body_id field to the CameraPrivateLibrary structure

2007-05-21  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c: Handle A70 and A80 in ptp2 driver, since this one
	  has better capture handling.

	* Makefile-files: Enable -DCANON_EXPERIMENTAL_SET_RELEASE_PARAMS
	  by default.

2007-03-13  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c: Handle A95 and S50 in ptp2 driver.
	  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1629132&group_id=8874&atid=108874

2007-01-02  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* library.c: Return storage information programmatically.

2006-11-13  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* library.c: Readded to Optura 20 (alternate id),
	  confirmed by reporter.

2006-06-24  David Selmeczi <seldavid@gmail.com>

	* library.c,canon.c: Added more 350D parameters.

2006-06-20  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	    Karl Tomlinson  <ktomlinson@users.sf.net>

	* library.c: Keep list_all_files setting permanent.

	* library.c: Also delete thumbnails (but only if
	  list_all_files is not set.)

2006-06-14  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* library.c: Mark up strings for translation.
	  Compare against translated string.
	
	  Mark up configuration widgets with symbolic names to
	  avoid spaces or translated strings in commandline modes.

2006-06-12  Paul Walmsley  <paul@booyaka.com>

	* canon.h: Fix build failure when CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_20D is not
	defined, by wrapping the release_params array in an '#ifdef
	CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_20D'

2006-06-11  Paul Walmsley  <paul@booyaka.com>

	* usb.c: Fix the debug messages in canon_usb_dialogue_full() to
	report the correct function name.

2006-06-11  Paul Walmsley  <paul@booyaka.com>

	* canon.[ch], usb.[ch], serial.[ch], library.c: Fix existing
	compile-time warnings.  Most of the fixes fell into one of these
	categories: (A) Converting length fields from signed int/long to
	unsigned, unless the meaning of the field is overloaded to pass
	back a gphoto2 error code (which are negative);
	(B) Converting fields of binary data used in camera interaction
	from signed char to unsigned char; (C) Casting unsigned char
	buffers passed to the gphoto2 port code, etc. to signed char;
	(D) Reviewing comparisons between signed and unsigned numbers, and
	ensuring that the comparisons are safely restricted to unsigned
	numbers when necessary.

	* Makefile.am: add '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter
	-Wno-missing-field-initializers' to CPPFLAGS.

2006-06-09  Paul Walmsley  <paul@booyaka.com>

	* usb.c: Modify identify camera code to retry quickly, and to
        double the retry delay with each failure.  This seems to work
        well for at least the Canon EOS 5D, where the first identify
        often is ignored by the camera, but the second identify camera
        generates a response, no matter how quickly it is sent after the
        first.

2006-06-07  Hubert Figuiere  <hub@figuiere.net>

	* doc/5d-capture: new documentation on capture for changes below.

2006-06-07  Paul Walmsley <paul@booyaka.com>

	* canon.c, usb.[ch], library.c: When the camera cannot capture an
	image due to a 'photographic failure,' return a gphoto2 error code
	resembling the actual failure code, rather than simply returning a
	generic error.  Tested on the Canon EOS 5D.

	* canon.[ch], usb.[ch]: Adds support for downloading "secondary
	images" -- the JPEGs created when the capture resolution is set to
	the "RAW + JPEG" modes -- for the Canon EOS 5D camera.
	
	* canon.[ch], library.c: Adds remote control over "release
	parameters" -- shutter speed, ISO speed, aperture, resolution,
	autofocus mode -- for the Canon EOS 5D camera. It might work with
	other Canon "class 6" cameras

	* canon.[ch], library.c: Add support for querying the camera's
	shutter speed, ISO speed, aperture, resolution, and focus mode via
	gphoto2's configuration interface.  Tested on the Canon EOS 5D.

	* canon.[ch]: Add canon_int_do_control_dialogue() and
	canon_int_do_control_dialogue_payload().  These functions execute
	a remote capture command on the camera and return the camera's
	response. canon_int_do_control_dialogue_payload() gives the caller
	full control over the payload.  We need these to retrieve and set
	the camera's release parameters.

	* usb.[ch]: Split canon_usb_dialogue() into two functions:
	canon_usb_dialogue_full(), which returns the full camera response
	packet, needed by canon_usb_long_dialogue() (and also by
	canon_int_get_release_params(), later in this patch series).
	
	* canon.c: Add the USB ID for the EOS 5D in PC connection mode.
	
	* canon.[ch]:  
	* library.c: gphoto2's Canon driver currently supports two capture
	modes: canon_int_capture_preview(), which captures a thumbnail to
	the host computer; and canon_int_capture_image(), which captures a
	full-sized image to the camera's drive.  We'd like to control each
	parameter -- the capture image size class and the capture
	destination -- independently, without breaking compatibility with
	current applications.  So, add a configuration option, "Capture
	size class," by which the user can specify whether to operate in
	"compatibility mode" (the default -- represents the driver's
	previous behavior), or whether to capture thumbnails, or
	full-sized images.  capture_preview() then always captures to the
	host computer, and capture_image() always captures to the camera's
	drive, no matter what the image's size.
	Our primary interest is in remote capture of full-sized images to
	the host computer.  We've observed that on the EOS 5D, with these
	patches applied, it's possible to capture full-sized images to the
	host computer or to the camera's drive.  Capturing thumbnails
	alone is supported only in name by these patches -- further work
	will be required to make that function.

2006-06-06  Paul Walmsley <paul@booyaka.com>

	* canon.[ch]: Replace the open-coded CANON_USB_CONTROL_INIT and
	CANON_USB_CONTROL_EXIT commands with functions, and set a flag in
	the host computer's camera state when the camera is in remote
	release control.
 
	* usb.c: canon_int_usb_poll_interrupt_pipe() can return a negative
	  result to indicate an error.  But canon_usb_capture_dialogue()
	  only checks whether the result was equal to 0 to test for an
	  error.

2005-11-02  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c: S1 IS and S2 IS in current CVS are not working,
	  comment out for now :(

2005-07-19  Stephen Westin
	* canon.c: Corrected "IXY Digital 60" to "IXY Digital 600" now
		that one has been sighted in the wild.
		Moved SD500/IXUS 700/IXY 600 from class 1 to class 5,
		since "get picture abilities" fails.

2005-06-21  Stephen Westin
	* canon.c: Added ID for PowerShot S2 IS.
		Revised format specifications in error/log messages:
		I think that all length-related quantities are now
		coerced to long, as some systems (e.g. MacOS X) have
		64-bit length types and 64-bit pointers are coming.

2005-06-10  Stephen Westin
	* canon.c: The PowerShot SD400/SD500 (aka Digital IXUS 50/60
		aka IXY Digital 55/60) don't support capture at all,
		according to Canon software manuals.
		Added support for a real "is this awake?" query
		(implemented in usb.c).

2005-06-10  Stephen Westin
	* canon.c: Moved PowerShot SD200/IXUS 30/IXY 40 from class 1 to
		class 6 for experimentation. This camera now needs
		CFLAGS=-DCANON_EXPERIMENTAL_20D to be included in the list.
		I kinda suspect that the SD400/IXUS 50/IXY 55 will need
		to go along with them. The A510 has been demonstrated working
		with the older protocol.

2005-05-05  Stephen Westin
	* canon.c: We now set and fetch the owner name correctly in new
		protocol.
		Error messages are improved.
		  o more text in place of numeric error codes
		  o "amount of data" -> "length"
		I think I now have gotten rid of "gp_context_message"
		(which stops for interactive input) when we are surprised
		at the length returned by a command.

2005-05-02  Stephen Westin
	* canon.c: Initial capability to get JPEG thumbnails from CR2 raw
		files (but not yet EXIF data).

2005-04-28  Stephen Westin
	Added several camcorders: Elura 50, Optura 10/MVX100i,
	   Optura Xi/MVX 3i/FV M1, Optura Xi/MVX 3i/FV M1, Optura 40/MVX25i
	   based on Web reports and some intelligent (I hope) guesses.
	Fixed Optura 20/MVX150i ID: 307f is for PTP, but 3080 is for us.
	   Based on reports from psapsa at users.sourceforge.net.
	We now attempt to exit from remote control mode on any capture error.
	Fixed one long vs. int warning.
	Added message for failure of file delete.
	Learned more about vendor ID's of several cameras.
	Moved PowerShot SD200/IXUS 30/Digital IXY 40 from class 4 to class 1
	  for testing.

2005-04-14  Stephen Westin
	Included new class 6 cameras in all the EOS conditionals (I think).
	Flag MVX100i as having no capture capability, which seems to be the case.
	  (I suspect other camcorders are in the same boat, but can't test the
	   hypothesis).

2005-04-08  Stephen Westin
	Backed out 300D changes; we now treat it as a class 4 camera, except
	  for interrupt messages during capture, which are like a class 6.
	300D is now in class 6 along with 20D and 350D.
	Modified canon_int_list_directory so it no longer returns ".." as
	  a directory.
	Modified canon_int_list_directory and canon_int_find_new_image
	  to handle directory ".." better and avoid memory access violations.
	Fixed log messages in canon_int_list_directory to give complete
	  function name.
	Made CR2 a different class of images, since it has no external thumbnail
	   file.
	use %ld and (long) casts for time_t values in *printf
	Moved PowerShot SD200 / Digital IXUS 30 / IXY Digital 40 from class 5
	  to class 4 (EOS-like) as an experiment.
	Added check for null pointer in directory walk to avoid access error.
	Corrected one C++-style comment.
	EOS Digital Rebel XT/EOS 350D/EOS Digital Kiss N is now a Class 6 camera,
	   and needs CFLAGS=-DCANON_EXPERIMENTAL_20D to be included in the code.
	fix unintended consequences of getting rid of warning messages
	The capacity and available variables are not NULL as verified above.
	But cap and ava are only set for the USB case, so we have to check for that.
	If you know the logic better, feel free to improve the code :)
	Capture from EOS 20D seems to work.
	We now print the camera firmware version in the debug log message
	  from "identify camera".

2005-03-31  Stephen Westin
	"Delete file" now works on EOS 20D.
	Added conditional CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_20D to enable 20D support, so
	   naive users won't be misled that this is actually trustworthy code.
	Camera model changes:
	 o MVX100i/Optura 20 is now 0x3082, not 0x3081.
	 o PowerShot A75 moved from class 5 to class 1 as a guess.
	Allow unexpected length of packet returned from "get picture abilities".
	Made canon_int_capture_preview() more like canon_int_capture_image().
	A bit of housekeeping here and there.
	Corrected vendor ID for EOS 350D/EOS Digital Rebel N/EOS Digital Kiss XT:
	  30ee is correct for Canon mode, 30ef is for PTP only.
	Updated and expanded list of models with USB ID's.
	Corrected bug in canon_int_set_file_attributes: one byte too short on
	  command (we need two NULs at the end). We now use
	  canon_usb_set_file_attributes in usb.c.
	Corrected canon_usb_set_file_attributes, which never could have worked.
	Fixed one type warning long vs. int
	Fixed sizes reported by get_disk_info for EOS 20D.
	Added PowerShot A510.

2005-03-14  Stephen Westin
	Fixes toward EOS 20D support:
	 o "flash device ID", "get disk info", and "delete file"
	   have different command codes.
	 o "get disk info" seems to return values in K rather than bytes.
	Moved PowerShot A60 & A70 from class 5 to class 1.
	Casts on various parameters to avoid warnings both on Linux and
	  on Mac OS X, which seem to have different sizes for size_t.
	Changed to use all 32 bytes, if present, from both camera
	  model and owner name from "identify camera" command.
	Some realignment.

2005-03-09  Stephen Westin
	Corrected an infinite loop when checking for filename
	  of a newly captured image, only if that was the only image
	  on the camera.
	Corrected protocol classes for IXUS v (I think it's the same camera
	   as PowerShot S110, but with different USB ID) and PowerShot S45
	   (we had reports that it was working with the EOS (class 4) code,
	   but somehow it was in class 5).
	Corrected one comment.
	Move PowerShot A300 from class 4 to class 1.
	Moved PowerShot A80 from class 4 to class 1.
	Whoops, I wanted the S400/IXUS 400 in class 1, not 3.
	Moved PowerShot S400 (Digital IXUS 400) from class 4 (EOS-like) to
	class 3.
	Moved PowerShot A400 back to class 5. I have my doubts, but don't
	know any better candidate.
	Moved PowerShot S400 from class 1 to class 4, which is where it
	apparently worked before (May 2003).
	Corrected a couple of gcc warnings on type of format specifiers
	(long int vs. int).
	unknown 4 (gleaned from Mac Info.plist file) should be 3080. It had
	  duplicated 3081.
	Moved PowerShot S400 (aka Digital IXUS 400) from class 4 to class 1.
	Added info on several camera models: both ones we know and ones we
	  would like to know.
	Added aliases for several cameras that are sold with different names
	  in different markets.
	Moved IXUS v from class 0 to class 1.

2005-01-16  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* canon.c: Added PowerShot SD200.

2005-01-15  Stephen Westin

	* canon.[ch]: Added PowerShot S70.

2004-12-16  Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* canon.[ch]: Added new protocol class 6 for EOS 20D (not yet implemented).
	              Removed macro IS_EOS, which is superseded by CANON_CLASS_4.

2004-12-16  Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* urb-interpret: Added some interpretation of interrupt read packets.
	 
	* urb-interpret: Updated to interpret output from SniffUSB v1.8, making it
	  incompatible with (some) older versions. To interpret output of older versions,
	  use an older version of urb-interpret.

2004-11-17  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.[ch]: Added PowerShot SD20.

2004-11-17  Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* canon.[ch]: Significant restructuring: there are now only 5
	  types of camera, so we should be able to add new cameras without modifying
	  canon.h.

	  Cleaned up a few type warnings in log message calls.

2004-10-20  Hubert Figuiere  <hfiguiere@teaser.fr>

	* canon.[ch]: Added EOS 20D

2004-09-11  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.[ch]: Added A75 as reported.

2004-05-30  Hubert Figuiere  <hfiguiere@teaser.fr>

	* canon.[ch]: Added PowerShot S410 / IXUS 430 by
	applying patch 963229
	http://www.gphoto.org/patches/?id=963229

2004-05-09  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* canon.[ch]: Added IXUS 500 as reported.

2004-03-07  Marcus Meissner  <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c: We check for consecutive 0s, so check for !*temp_ch.
	
2004-02-03  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* serial.c, usb.c: Use largest file size limit
	* canon.c, canon.h: Note improper use of file size limits
	
2004-01-31  Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Richard Simpson <richard@huskydog.org.uk>
	  Support for Canon MV650i.

2004-01-14  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Add support for Canon ZR-70MC
	  Thanks for the report by Kevin R. Bulgrien.

2004-01-02  Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>

	* canon.c, usb.c: lock keys and audio support in PowerShot S50, from
	  rcaputo@users.sf.net

2003-11-08  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Added support for Optura 20 (reported by Walt H)

2003-10-27  Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.de>

	* canon.c: PowerShot S50 and A300 got lost somewhere.

2003-09-20  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h, usb.c, usb.h: Added G5 support
	  (patches by Andreas Klemm <andreas@FreeBSD.org>)

2003-10-10 Olivier Crete <tester@tester.ca>
	* library.c: Add Canon A80

2003-09-20  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h, usb.c: Added support for 
          EOS 300D/Digital Rebel/KISS Digital, thanks to Johan Herland 
          and T.V.

2003-05-19 Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* canon.c, canon.h: Added 4 patches with support
	  for the A300, S400, A60 and A70. (Might not be 100%
	  correct in specifying subtypes and capture ability.)

	  These seem to parallel support PTP and Canon mode
	  with 1 USB id according to traces sent. Strange.

2003-05-06 Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* library.c,canon.c: 2 bug fixes for audio files from
	  Ben Low <ben@bdlow.net>.

2003-04-07 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Update README, TODO, ChangeLog
	* Support for Optura 200 MC/MVX2i camcorder

2003-04-04 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* CANON_PS_A70 is now CANON_PS_PRO70, to avoid confusion with new
	  PowerShot A70, a completely different camera.
	* Added comments with product ID's for A60, A70, which are PTP-only.
	* Added ID's for EOS 10D; will use same code as EOS D30/D60.
	* Image key and size (for immediate download from capture) are now
	  in the CameraPrivateLibrary structure, so they aren't passed as
	  explicit parameters.
	* capture_step moved to CameraPrivateLibrary structure to keep track
	  of interrupt reads during image capture; this was formerly a local
	  variable in canon_usb_capture_dialogue().
	* Fixed comment since we now supply a real serial number with each
	  command packet.
	* New function canon_usb_set_file_time() to be used after file upload.
	* New function canon_usb_set_file_attributes().
	* New functions canon_usb_get_captured_thumbnail(),
	  canon_usb_get_captured_image(), canon_int_capture_preview(),
	  is_audio(), canon_int_filename2audioname().
	* Transfer mode bits are now in enum canonTransferMode.
	* New enum canonDownloadImageType.
	* Converted #define's in usb.h to enums
	* Moved prototypes to end of usb.h, since they now use the enums.
	* Max read size USB_BULK_READ_SIZE is now 0x1400 to match
	  Canon software; was 0x3000.
	* Moved transfer mode bits to from usb.h to canon.h.
	* Messed with file upload; now sets file time from host file time.
	  Still doesn't work any better.

2003-02-28 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Removed "capturing" field from CameraPrivateLibrary; it was unused.
	* EOS capture is no longer flagged as "experimental".
	* Implemented canon_capture_preview(); it was a no-op.

2003-02-27  Marcus Meissner <marcus@jet.franken.de>
	
	* library.c: We support EXIF download.

2003-02-27 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Changed all C++-style comments ("//") to C-style "/* ... */".
          Gcc allows C++ form in C programs, but it's not quite ANSI.
	* In canon_int_capture_image(), deduce path and file name of
	  captured image and return as specified in the API
	* Added function canon_usb_list_all_dirs() to support path and
	  file name deduction in canon_int_capture_image().

2003-02-18 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* canon_usb_capture_dialogue() now gets error context
	* Added extra NUL to end of "delete file" command; this
	  eliminates an error code 0200000086.
	* canon_usb_unlock_keys() now gets error context and reports
	  errors (non-zero status code in 0x50 of reply).
	* Better error checking in canon_usb_lock_keys(); now we
	  *do* know what those bytes mean (they are a 32-bit status
	  code).
	* Change locking code so that older "default" cameras are
	  now explicit; the new default is like S45 and G3, on the
	  assumption that new cameras will probably behave like this.
	* canon_usb_capture_dialogue() now gets error context to
	  pass to canon_usb_capture_dialogue().

2003-02-14 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Corrected comment explaining path returned from capture.
	* Added labels for all values of canonCamModel, for gtk-doc.
	* Added PowerShot G3 to special-case locking: use non-EOS locking,
          but no "get photo abilities" command.

2003-02-11 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Tidy comments (esp. for gtk-doc)
	* Return "*UNKNOWN*" for both path and file names from capture, since
	  I don't know how to get the information after capture. Previously,
	  random garbage was returned.
	* Flag GP_DEBUG messages with name of originating function.
	* Clean up better on capture error (exit control mode).
	* Convert many constant #define's to enum's.
	* Moved many constant #define's from library.h to canon.h.
	* Moved macro IS_EOS() to canon.h.
	* Supply unique serial number in each command.
	* Alter "already awake" initialization for EOS cameras.
	  This still doesn't work :(.
	* Alter key locking. EOS cameras are locked just before
	  "release shutter" command and unlocked as soon as possible
	  afterward. PowerShot cameras are unlocked at initialization
	  and can't be unlocked from software. The user must unplug the
	  USB cable to unlock the keys on these cameras.
	* Unify polling of interrupt pipe in canon_usb_poll_interrupt_pipe().
	* Read interrupt pipe to clear it, both before "release shutter"
	  command and after an error (interrupt messages out of sequence)
	  in capture.
	* Increase timeout for "release shutter" command. EOS cameras
	  sometimes take a long time (>10sec) to complete this command.
	  Is this because of a buffer flush?
	* Improve handling of interrupt messages in "release shutter".
	* Check status at 0x50 in response, where appropriate, and report
	  a non-zero status code via GP_DEBUG (in canon_usb_dialogue).
	* Increase MAX_INTERRUPT_TRIES from 4000 to 12000 to allow worst-case
	  timing: a D60 writing a raw file to CF.

2003-01-27 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Major cleanup of comments to make gtk-doc work.
	* Moved "defines for error handling" from canon.h to serial.h.
	* Moved JPEG stream byte #defines from serial.h to canon.h.
	* Slight update of doc string for screen width (library.c).
	* Minor improvements to urb-interpret.
	* Moved MAX_RETRIES from usb.c to usb.h, renamed MAX_INTERRUPT_RETRIES.
	* Rewrite of interrupt-pipe reads based on new insight
	  into communication structure.
	* Now seems to work with EOS D30 as well as PowerShot cameras.
	  Not yet working with EOS D60.
	* Commented prototype for dump_hex in util.h, as it isn't actually
	  defined anywhere.
	* Created doc/canon-api.sgml, doc/canon-sections.txt
	  with tentative structure for documentation.

2003-01-13 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Improved some debug logging; added interpretation of power status
	* Re-inserted "get picture abilities" for non-EOS cameras
	* Created special case for PowerShot S45, which (like EOS) doesn't
	  implement the "get picture abilities" command, but (like PowerShot)
	  uses the base "lock keys" command.

2003-01-10  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE #ifdefs
	* usb.[ch]: removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE #ifdefs
	* library.[ch]: removed CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE #ifdefs
	* canon.[ch], serial.c: new serial detection code (with dedicated ID strings)

2003-01-10 Stephen H. Westin <westin@graphics.cornell.edu>

	* Corrected capture sequence, including reads from interrupt pipe.
	  Tested on PowerShot G2 and S45; *not* working for EOS D30/D60
	  cameras.
	* Added function canon_int_get_picture_abilities (currently unused).
	* New command "EOS get body ID" returns camera serial number.
	* Added command and response lengths for "Get available shot" and "Get
	  custom function"
	* Corrected canon_int_get_battery() when return values are NULL
	  pointers.
	* Extended timeout for remote control init, as camera must extend lens.
	* Corrected spelling in various places.
	* urb-interpret: fixed a few bugs. Improved handling of interrupt pipe
	  reads: we now discard those with zero length, but flag and keep others.
2002-11-20  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot G3 (A. Marinichev)

2002-11-03  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot S230

2002-11-02  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot S45

2002-10-25  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* usb.c: added fix for EOS D60 unlocking by Fredrik (reported to work)

2002-10-03  Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: -I$(top_builddir)/libgphoto2

2002-08-28  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c: s/EXPERIMENTAL_/CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_/
	* canon.[ch], usb.[ch]: s/EXPERIMENTAL_/CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_/
	* library.c: only report EXPERIMENTAL on USB cams
	* Makefile.am: removed EXPERIMENTAL_ CFLAGS stuff
	* README: Added note about new CANON_EXPERIMENTAL_ stuff
	
2002-07-29  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.[ch]: support for PowerShot A100, A200
	
2002-07-29  Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* canon.h: Make CVS compile again by adding CANON_PS_A100 to the
	  enumeration.

2002-07-24  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c: started to add duplicate cams
	* library.c: report upload cap only if possible
	* mkpatch: removed, last change from 2000, and not useful for quite
		some time now

2002-05-01  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* canon.c, canon.h, usb.c: added support for EOS D60

2002-04-19  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Added support for the IXUS 330,
	  reported working by Oliver Herrmann.

2002-04-08  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c: better comments, fixed two UTC to localtime
	  typos in debug messages, better debug messages in
	  canon_int_set_time().

	* library.c: fixed reporting of camera time difference in
	  camera_summary() which did not handle DST.

2002-03-29  Hans Ulrich Niedermann  <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c: merged in USB upload patch by Matthias Kramm 
	                 (using #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_UPLOAD)
                     mark driver as experimental when compiled 
	                 with any of the EXPERIMENTAL_ flags
	* canon.h: merged in USB upload patch by Matthias Kramm
	           properly use EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE for int capturing;
	* usb.c: merged in USB upload patch by Matthias Kramm
	* Makefile.am: define EXPERIMENTAL_UPLOAD if requested

2002-03-23  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c,Makefile.am: made capture stuff a little easier for testing
	* canon.h: removed last remains from obsolete caching layer
	* library.c,canon.h,usb.c: accelerate non-capture operations by
	  omitting sleep(2) hack when not capturing
	* library.c: added G2 to list of supposedly capture-able cams
	* canon.h: removed last remains from obsolete caching layer

2002-03-22  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h: Added support for the A40, reported
	  by David Willmore.

2002-03-18  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h, library.c, canon.c, canon.h:
	  Committed Emile Snyder's USB remote capture code. This is
	  work in progress, but to ease distribution and avoid
	  conflicts it is included here inside
	  #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_CAPTURE

	* README: Updated models known to work with the 'new'
	  driver and added a paragraph about the remote capture code
	  included today.

2002-03-08  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.{c,h}, library.c:
	  Implemented EXIF file type support, re-worked thumbnail
	  handling and got rid of the ../../libgphoto2/exif.*
	  dependency.

	* usb.c: Don't keylock S10 - it does that by itself when
	  set to PC mode. Reported by Philipp Kolmann.

2002-01-09  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* *.{c,h}: Re-indented and removed everything
	  #ifdef OBSOLETE to make sources clean before gPhoto2
	  2.0 is released.

2002-01-08  christophe barbé <christophe.barbe.ml@online.fr>

	* usb.c: Change model detection to look at model name instead
	  of USB vendor/product ID since this is required to make the
	  current implementation of overriding camera model work.

2002-01-21  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c: Don't key lock Pro 90 IS cameras, they do not support
	  it. Reported by Karl Thaller.

	* usb.c, Protocol:
	  Fixed a bug in the init sequence code (write 0x50 bytes like
	  the Windows driver - not 0x10 like we used to). This actually
	  made another bug (in the cameras firmware) surface and we had
	  to mimic the Windows drivers workaround which is to call
	  'Identify camera' multiple times.

	  If you want to read more about this, go read the gphoto-devel
	  archives from around this date. Look for messages about trouble
	  with Canon G1, Pro90IS and EOS D30 cameras.

	* canon.c, canon.h, library.c, serial.c:
	  Reverted behaviour of canon_int_get_time() to return time in
	  cameras time instead of converted to UTC since it makes more
	  sense to display the same time as the camera does on it's
	  display.

	  Made canon_int_get_time() always return gphoto2 status codes.

2002-01-15  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* *.c: gp_camera_status -> gp_context_status

2002-01-14  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, library.c: More careful buffer size checking in some
	  places. We should do a real audit of these.

	* library.c: Fixed mkdir and rmdir functions which did not convert
	  from gphoto paths to canon paths.

2002-01-13  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* *.[c,h]: Replaces last call to gp_camera_set_error (I oversaw one
	  hidden in the header file).

2002-01-13  Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* *.[c,h]: Replace calls to gp_camera_set_error by gp_context_error.

2002-01-12  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* README: New readme for new driver
	
2002-01-11  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* *.[ch]: checked in rewritten driver which uses GPFilesystem
		  directly (from the hun branch)
	
2002-01-08  Dan Fandrich <dan@coneharvesters.com>

	* Makefile.am: Removed redundant CFLAGS and LDFLAGS lines

2002-01-07  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c: Small fix to Dan's portable timezone code from
	yesterday. The wrong time was set.

	* library.c: Improved camera_summary() with better error-checking
	and nicer formatted output.

2002-01-06  Dan Fandrich <dan@coneharvesters.com>

	* util.h: added MIN and MAX definitions
	* library.c: added support for locale-specific thousands separator
	* canon.c: added support for tm.tm_gmtoff to get time zone offset

2002-01-04  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h:
	Changed canon_int_get_time() to convert the time to
	GMT before returning it to the caller to simplify
	time operations elsewhere.

	Changed canon_int_set_time() to accept the time to
	set as a parameter instead of always setting it to
	the computers time. Also use correct endian code
	to convert it to little endian before sending it to
	the camera and hopefully convert the time to local
	timezone before setting it since Canon cameras
	know nothing about timezone.

	* library.c: Reflect changes to get/set_time.

	* canon.c, library.c: Improve error checking and
	debug diagnostics when camera does not return the
	expected amount of data.

2002-01-01  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c: Don't keylock G1 cameras, they do not
	  support it. Reported by Jarno Elonen.

2001-12-24  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* library.c: stop reporting broken camera abilities

2001-12-23  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, canon.h, serial.c, usb.c, util.c, util.h :

	  Patch from Michel Dänzer <daenzer@debian.org>,

	  Handle endian issues when communicating with the
	  cameras by using the new _byteorder.h include
	  provided to us by gphoto2 autoconf.

	* canon.c, canon.h, library.c, serial.c, usb.c :
	  Put all model data in a canonCamModelData structure
	  in canon.h so that there is only one place that has
	  to be changed when adding new models. This is also
	  a start to defining properties/abilities for cameras
	  in a central place instead of checking what model
	  we are talking to everywhere in the code.

	  Output cameras time and the difference between it
	  and the host computers time in --summary.

2001-12-15  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* library.c, canon.h:
	  Moved models[] from library.c to canon.h and added
	  canonCamModel model to models[].

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Identify USB cameras based on USB vendor/product ID.
	  This was necessary because we need to know what
	  model it is before initializing since some models
	  do that differently.

	* usb.c:
	  Add special treatment of EOS D30 cameras to
	  canon_usb_camera_init() when camstat is 'A'. Simplified
	  canon_usb_camera_init() in general.

	* usb.c:
	  Moved the code from canon_usb_ready() to
	  canon_usb_init() - canon_usb_ready() should send a
	  'ping' packet to check if the camera is alive instead
	  of doing stuff like identification and key locking.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to read responses in two
	  passes - one that reads as much as possible that is
	  divideable with 0x40 and then one that reads the
	  expected number of bytes modulus 0x40. This is what
	  the windows driver does and it appears some cameras
	  (EOS D30) likes this better.

2001-12-06  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* canon.c, library.c:
	  Re-worked file deleting after reports saying it didn't
	  work. Now it works for me at least.

2001-12-05  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.h:
	  Added EOS D30 (and possibly other models) commands to
	  lock and unlock camera keys.

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Renamed canon_usb_keylock() to canon_usb_lock_keys().
	  Added canon_usb_unlock_keys(), the only camera known to
	  support this is the EOS D30. This is called from
	  camera_exit().
	  Corrected comments about how canon_usb_dialogue() works.

	* canon.c: Improved error checking on return from
	  canon_{usb,serial}_dialogue() calls and changed some
	  functions to return GP_ codes instead of hard coded
	  integer values.

	* library.c:
	  Call canon_usb_unlock_keys() from camera_exit() if
	  using USB.

2001-12-04  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>
	
	* canon.c: Improved debug output in canon_int_get_time().

	* canon.c, canon.h, serial.c, serial.h, usb.c, usb.h:
	  Moved canon_int_serial_ready() to serial.c and renamed
	  it to canon_serial_ready().
	  Moved canon_int_usb_ready() to usb.c and renamed
	  it to canon_usb_ready().

	* library.c: Don't say we are switching off camera if
	  USB, since we are not.

	* usb.c: Make canon_usb_keylock() not try to keylock
	  EOS D30 cameras, they seem to do keylocking different.

2001-12-01  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Added canon_usb_get_dirents().

	* serial.c, serial.h:
	  Added canon_serial_get_dirents().

	* canon.h: added CANON_MINIMUM_DIRENT_SIZE.

	* canon.c, canon.h:
	  Exchanged canon_int_list_directory() with my
	  rewritten version. At least some hypothetical bugs
	  fixed, easier to understand and proper error-checking.
	  This should hopefully not break serial, since this is
	  almost the same code as I used when debugging other
	  serial stuff on Philippes computer/camera from 1600
	  km distance a few weeks ago.

	* library.c:
	  Re-wrote _get_file_path() since it was really hard to
	  understand. The first time I tried to understand it I
	  got it all wrong and even added some faulty comments.

	Also replaced some random gp_debug_printf() with
	GP_DEBUG() and re-indented *.c.

2001-11-29  Fredrik <fredrik@krixor.xy.org>

	* usb.c, usb.h:
	  Implemented canon_usb_keylock() which locks the
	  cameras keys and turns off the LCD.

	* usb.c:
	  Changed a read of 0x44 bytes to two, one of 0x40
	  and one of 0x4 bytes. This seems to fix the problems
	  we have had with initialization only working every
	  second time for some cameras.

	  Changed canon_usb_dialogue() to return the number of
	  bytes the caller is interested in rather than the
	  total number of bytes read from the camera for
	  "non-long" reads.

	* canon.c:
	  Move some more code from canon_int_ready() to
	  canon_int_serial_ready().

	  Don't show init errors with gp_camera_status(), use
	  gp_camera_set_error() for that.

	  Updated canon_int_usb_ready() to call new
	  canon_usb_keylock() and also do things in a slightly
	  different order.

2001-11-27  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* README: added note about CRW (raw) support
	* canon.c: added support for PowerShot S40
	* canon.h: added support for PowerShot S40
	* library.c: added support for PowerShot S40
	
2001-11-27  Hans Ulrich Niedermann <gp@n-dimensional.de>

	* ChangeLog: created new file
	* Changelog: declared deprecated
