* Fix all FIXME's

* Add calls to gp_frontend_status()

* In cases where an error occurs during transfer, the driver can get
out of sync with the device. From that point on, the driver is unable
to successfully initialize the driver, even for new gPhoto sessions. A
reboot (power-off, power-on) of the MSAC-SR1 device helps. See if it
is possible to do a proper init in such a case.
