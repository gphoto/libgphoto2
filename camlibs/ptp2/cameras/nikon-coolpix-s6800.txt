Hi

I have been able to connect a Nikon Coolpix s6800 successfully and the
relevant information is below/attached.

I discovered the PTP property 0xd002 is image mode with values and output as
follows;

7 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - FINE, Compression 1/4, Size - 4608x3456 -
16MP (approx. 7MB)

6 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 4608x3456 -
16MP (approx. 3.6MB)

5 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 3264x2448 -
8MP (approx. 2MB)

4 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 2272x1704 -
4MP (approx. 1MB)

3 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 1600x1200 -
2M (approx. 530kB)

2 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 640x480
-VGA (approx. 140kB)

1 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 4608x2592 -
12MP (approx. 2.9MB)

0 - Scene mode - AUTO, Quality - NORMAL, Compression 1/8, Size - 4608x2592 -
12MP (approx. 2.9MB)

Do you know what these properties could be for?

Property 0xd407:(read only) (type=0x6) 1

Property 0xd406:(readwrite) (type=0xffff) ''

See attached for summary and config details.

However, I have not been as successful with a Nikon Coolpix s3700 so I will
post this as a ticket.

Finally I have not been able to find out if an Olympus DMD E-M10 can be
controlled completely by gphoto (ie image resolution and quality). Do you
know how I can find this out as it is rather expensive to purchase one and
fail.

Thanks for your support.

Thanks,
