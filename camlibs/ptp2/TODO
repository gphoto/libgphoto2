Unordered TODO list:

-- gp_camera_capture() should return path to captured image!

-- free() all malloced memory upon exit!

-- update params.handles and params.objectinfo structures after deletion of
folders/files

-- lot of internal error handling code is needed and the whole internal
error reporting scheme has to be reorganized and improved!

-- consider the idea of adding lasterror variable to PTPParams
