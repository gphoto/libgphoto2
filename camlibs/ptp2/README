*About this software*
=====================

This folder contains following code:
ptp.c		- the main libptp2 code; this library is used to communicate
		  with PTP devices
ptp.h		- libptp2 header files
ptp-pack.c	- this file is included into ptp.c (internal code)
library.c	- gphoto2 PTP driver (used by gphoto2 to communicate with
		  PTP devices)
ptpcam.c	- the software to manimpulate PTP cameras
		  (currently get/set properties); it does things that
		  you can't do with gphoto2

The libptp2 library is under developement yet, but is considered to be
functional and quite stable.
It was written to be used with gphoto2, but can be easily used with any other
software.



===================
*Supported Cameras*
===================

NOTE that if your camera is not on the list it DOES NOT mean that it is not
supported! Most of USB cameras designed after 2002 are PTP or USB Mass
Storage. In both cases the camera is supported under Linux!

Below the list of cameras explicitly supported by gphoto2 ptp driver:

==============================================

Above list might be outdated!

Note that for some HP, Nikon, Canon and Sony cameras you have to switch
them to PTP mode as in most cases the camera is dual mode:
PTP and USB Mass Storage.
For some cameras it even changes the Product ID number, so don't panic if
it does not match the one listed above, just switch the mode.
Don't ask me how to do it. Refer to camera documentation.

If you know that your camera might be a PTP one, you may test it
against this code even if it's not on the list above. If it's really in
PTP mode, the USB interface class should be set to 6 (it's called "still").
You may check this by reading /proc/bus/usb/devices, for example:

cat /proc/bus/usb/devices | grep "Cls=06"

If you find something like this:

I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 3 Cls=06(still) Sub=01 Prot=01 Driver=(none)
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
that means that your camera is a PTP one.
The ptp driver should detect that camera by interface class as "USB PTP
Class Camera" and allow downloading the pictures and do other stuff exactly
the same way as if it would be detected by product and vendor ID.

If you're not Linux user try compiling ptpcam (if you have the source
tarball of libgphoto2 ptpcam is build automaticaly camlibs/ptp2 folder).

ptpcam --list-devices will search through all usb devices looking for a
PTP one.


================================
*Solving and reporting problems*
================================

To solve the problem stick to gphoto2 CLI, forget about the GUI now.
Use gphoto2 -L to see if it detects the camera.

If you see something like this:

~> gphoto2 -L
Unable to get descriptor (-1)                                                   
(... lot of other errors ...)

it may mean that you're working as user while the usb access is restricted.
See gphoto2-manual, section "Setting up your system for use with libgphoto2
and gphoto2", subsection "Setting up permissions for USB ports"
(http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/doc/manual/permissions-usb.html).

If the gphoto2 detects the camera but then fails with some error messages
please report the bug sending the mail to gphoto-devel@gphoto.org or
directly to me at: emsi@emsi.it.pl.
The mail should contain the full output of gphoto2 -L --debug with locale
language set to _ENGLISH_.
For example in bash do:
env LANG=C gphoto2 --debug -L
tcsh/csh:
setenv LANG C; gphoto2 --debug -L

WARGING!!! Before sending any mail make sure you read the notes in
"Supported Cameras" above.

Enjoy!

Documentation

While ptp transactions usage seems to be quite obvious the ptp events
handling code should be documented.
