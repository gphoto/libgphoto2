	* soundvision.h: Include _stdint.h to get fixed-size integer types.

2002-02-11  Vince Weaver <vince@deater.net>
        * Completely redid tiger support.  Involved separating out
	  more functions from Agfa, extensive looking at usb-traces, etc.
	  delete and image-capture should now work on Tiger.  File upload 
	  should work but doesn't.  
	* All attempts to fix the stall upon
	  subsequent re-running of gphoto2 failed.  It seems to be
	  somewhat arbitrary.  Sometimes a reset helps, sometimes not.
        * Agfa-CL18 should work more or less same as before.
	* Cleaned up a lot of the code.
