2002-10-25  Michael Koltan <koltan@gmx.de>

	* Rewrote the initialization procedure
	  again to use the speed parameter
	  set by gphoto2

	* Allowed timeout errors when 
	  capturing a picture; that's for Koen, who
	  has strange communication drops in his
	  setup

2002-10-20  Michael Koltan <koltan@gmx.de>

	* Improved error recovery on package read
	  timeout when downloading file from camera
	+ Corrected error in battery status / ac
	  adaptor connection. Reading of battery
	  status still doesn't work, so took the
	  unreliable display from summary

	* Made exp_compensation a signed char, removed
	  exposure_compensation (unused).

2002-09-11  Michael Koltan  <koltan@gmx.de>

	  It's too slow for applications like
	  gtkam
