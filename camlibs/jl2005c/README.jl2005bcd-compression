History of the reverse engineering of the compression used in the
	JL2005B, JL2005C, and JL2005D cameras
-----------------------------------------------------------

All of these cameras use a compression format which is derived from JPEG
but is in several respects non-standard, making the job of understanding
it very difficult.

Thus, after several years have passed by, during which it has been possible
to get the raw files out of these cameras but not possible to do anything
with the data in the raw files, a task force was started to deal with the
problem. The results of the reverse engineering work by Adam Rubin and
Bertrik Sikken were shared by means of a wiki page with Hans de Goede
and me (Theodore Kilgore). What is known as of April 10, 2010 is listed
at

A dump of this page is given below.

The description provided in this webpage was used to write the decompression
code. The objective was to provide output in a standard, uncompressed bitmap
format in order to provide the opportunity to apply whatever techniques for
image enhancement or postprocessing that might be needed. The format chosen
for this was PPM, used in many other camera libraries in libgphoto2.

Faced with the choice of incorporating a modified variant of libjpeg in
the decompression code, for ultimate inclusion in libgphoto2/camlibs/jl2005c,
or else finding a way to use the standard library functions of libjpeg,
Hans de Goede found a way to use the standard library functions with minimal
modification.

The details of how the decompression algorithm needs to work are well laid
out in the dump of the wiki web page (below). See especially the section
called "Entropy coded data."

Introduction

This page describes the image format used in cameras with the Jeilin 2005
B/C/D chip.

This chip stores images in a non-standard JPEG-like format. To understand
the information on this page, it is recommended to have a basic
understanding of JPEG compression.
Image format

The image file seems to consist of the following parts:

    * a 16-byte image header
    * some kind of thumbnail of the actual image
    * entropy-coded JPEG-like image data 

These parts are described in the following paragraphs.
Image header

The 16-byte image header is the very first thing in an raw image file
(copied directly from the PAT) and contains basic image meta-data. All words
are stored big-endian, and block size is 0x80 bytes for the JL2005B and
0x200 bytes for the JL2005C and JL2005D chips. "Something happens" means
that I don't know yet what, if any, the effects are. Additions and
corrections to this section are welcome!
Byte 	Meaning
0x00 	Always observed as zero so far, but something happens if it's 0x01
or 0x21, and something else happens if it's 0x11.
0x01 	Camera ID or attributes? If bit 4 is set, gamma correction is
enabled. If a value elsewhere is set, then if bit 7 is set, then bits 2 and
3 do something.
0x02 	Bit 4: 0 = lower compression ratio, 1 = higher compression ratio

Bits 0-1: resolution of photo (camera-dependent), 00 = CIF or VGA, 01 = QCIF
or QVGA, 02 = SVGA if supported

All other bits have always been observed as zero so far.
0x03 	Bits 0-6 = image quality factor (100% is best quality), specifics
below under "Quantization Table"

Bit 7: if set, read the raw file into memory but do not decode it
0x04 	Image height, in units of 8 pixels
0x05 	Image width, in units of 8 pixels
0x06-0x07 	Total size of image data in blocks, including thumbnail if
any
0x08 	When writing the raw file, if byte 0x03 bit 7 is set (decode image)
and byte 0x02 bit 4 is set (higher compression), then a workspace area of (
width * (photo height in pixels - this byte) / 2 ) bytes is allocated,
instead of width * height.

When reading in the raw file, if byte 0x03 bit 7 is clear and byte 0x02 bit
4 is clear, the value used later on for image height in pixels follows the
same equation.

I don't (yet) know why either of these are done.
0x09 	If there's a thumbnail image (as detailed below), the thumbnail's
length in blocks is this byte divided by four. So far, 0x60 or 0xf0 for this
byte means a thumbnail (resolution 96x64 or 128x120 pixels respectively).
The significance of any other value is not known.
0x0a 	Another camera ID or attributes? Bits 0-1 do something.
0x0b 	Unknown -- always observed as zero so far
0x0c-0x0d 	Starting address of photo in storage medium, in blocks.
0x0e-0x0f 	Word, function unknown.

(part of this table was derived from the jl2005c code already in gphoto)
Thumbnail image

Directly following the image header, sometimes, is a thumbnail image. See
"Image Header" byte 0x09, above, to detect whether one is present.

From observation:

    * JL2005B -- no thumbnails
    * JL2005C -- some have thumbnails; if so, 96x64 pixels
    * JL2005D -- many have thumbnails; if so, 128x120 pixels 

Note that the aspect ratio of the thumbnails is not necessarily the same as
that of the picture.

Pixels in the thumbnail are encoded left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Each pixel
of the thumbnail image is represented by a 16-bit word, big endian encoded,
with bits assigned to R, G and B components as follows (a.k.a. RGB565):

    * bit 15-11: red
    * bit 10- 5: green
    * bit 4 - 0: blue 

Entropy coded data

Following the thumbnail image (if present), is the entropy coded data. This
data looks a bit like the entropy coded data used in JPEG images.


The image is sub-divided as follows:

    * The image is divided in vertical strips of 16 pixels wide and height
      pixels high, so the whole image consists of width/16 strips, encoded
      from left-to-right.
    * Each strip is subdivided in MCUs (minimum coded unit) of 16x16 pixels,
      encoded from top-to-bottom.
    * Each MCU consists of 4 blocks of 8x8 pixels each, containing pixels
from the Bayer mosaicing pattern. They appear in the following order:
          o First the green pixels of the top half of the 16x16 pixel MCU
          o Then the green pixels of the bottom half of the 16x16 pixel MCU
          o Then the red pixels for the entire MCU
          o Finally the blue pixels for the entire MCU 
    * The order of the red, green and blue pixels in the Bayer pattern is as
      follows: RG/GB. This means the first line of a MCU starts with a red
      pixel, then a green pixel from the first green line from the first
      green block. The second line starts with a green pixel from the second
      green line from the first green block, then a blue pixel. 


With respect to the encoding:

    * MCUs in a strip are encoded like a JPEG MCU. There are only two
      huffman tables (one for the DC and for the AC coefficients) and there
      is only one quantisation table.
    * The blue and red 8x8 blocks inside an MCU each have a DC coefficient
      that is differential to the DC coefficient of the same block in the
      previous MCU, like in standard JPEG.
    * The two green 8x8 blocks inside an MCU share a single DC coefficient,
      so the DC coefficient of the first green block is differential to the
      one from the second block and vice versa.
    * The DC coefficients in the first MCU in a strip are not differential,
      but contain the absolute value.
    * 0xFF bytes in the entropy coded data are followed by 0x00 stuff-bytes,
just like they are in JPEG.
    * A strip is encoded as a bunch of MCUs, followed by 0xFFD9 (this is the
End-Of-Image marker in JPEG) and padded with 0x00 until the next 16-byte
      aligned address. The start of the entropy coded stream is considered
to be address 0 in this case.
    * An image is encoded as a bunch of strips, followed by bogus data until
the end of the total image data (which is a multiple of 0x80 or 0x200). 

Huffman table

The Huffman table used is the recommended table for the luminance component
from the JPEG specification. In C, encoded as a JPEG DHT table, this looks
like:

static const unsigned char dht_table[] = {
	0xFF, 0xC4,
	0x00, 0xD2

	// luma DC
	0x00,
	0x00, 0x01, 0x05, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00,
0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
	0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A,
0x0B,

	// luma AC
	0x10,
	0x00, 0x02, 0x01, 0x03, 0x03, 0x02, 0x04, 0x03, 0x05, 0x05, 0x04,
0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x7D,
	0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x00, 0x04, 0x11, 0x05, 0x12, 0x21, 0x31, 0x41,
0x06, 0x13, 0x51, 0x61, 0x07,
	0x22, 0x71, 0x14, 0x32, 0x81, 0x91, 0xA1, 0x08, 0x23, 0x42, 0xB1,
0xC1, 0x15, 0x52, 0xD1, 0xF0,
	0x24, 0x33, 0x62, 0x72, 0x82, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19,
0x1A, 0x25, 0x26, 0x27, 0x28,
	0x29, 0x2A, 0x34, 0x35, 0x36, 0x37, 0x38, 0x39, 0x3A, 0x43, 0x44,
0x45, 0x46, 0x47, 0x48, 0x49,
	0x4A, 0x53, 0x54, 0x55, 0x56, 0x57, 0x58, 0x59, 0x5A, 0x63, 0x64,
0x65, 0x66, 0x67, 0x68, 0x69,
	0x6A, 0x73, 0x74, 0x75, 0x76, 0x77, 0x78, 0x79, 0x7A, 0x83, 0x84,
0x85, 0x86, 0x87, 0x88, 0x89,
	0x8A, 0x92, 0x93, 0x94, 0x95, 0x96, 0x97, 0x98, 0x99, 0x9A, 0xA2,
0xA3, 0xA4, 0xA5, 0xA6, 0xA7,
	0xA8, 0xA9, 0xAA, 0xB2, 0xB3, 0xB4, 0xB5, 0xB6, 0xB7, 0xB8, 0xB9,
0xBA, 0xC2, 0xC3, 0xC4, 0xC5,
	0xC6, 0xC7, 0xC8, 0xC9, 0xCA, 0xD2, 0xD3, 0xD4, 0xD5, 0xD6, 0xD7,
0xD8, 0xD9, 0xDA, 0xE1, 0xE2,
	0xE3, 0xE4, 0xE5, 0xE6, 0xE7, 0xE8, 0xE9, 0xEA, 0xF1, 0xF2, 0xF3,
0xF4, 0xF5, 0xF6, 0xF7, 0xF8,
	0xF9, 0xFA
};

Quantisation table

The magnitude of the elements in the quantisation table in JPEG-like
encoding basically determines the compromise between image quality and image
size. A quantisation table with small values results in a high quality but
large image and a quantisation table with big values results in a low
quality but small image.

The quantisation table used in the Jeilin encoding is a scaled version of a
base quantisation table. This base quantisation table is very similar
(within a few percent) to the one given in the JPEG specification.

The scale factor (in percents) is calculated from the quality value from the
header (call it q) in the following way:

    * q = 0: scale factor = 5000
    * 0 < q <= 50: scale factor = 5000 / q
    * 50 < q <= 100: scale factor = 2 * (100 - q)
    * q > 100: assume q = 100 

Scaling is done by multiplying each element of the table by the scale
factor, dividing by 100 and rounding to the nearest integer value. The
minimum value of an element after scaling is 1 and the maximum value is 255.
