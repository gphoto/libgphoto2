/* The Topfield packet handling is a bit unusual. All data is stored in

 * data is byte swapped.
 *
 * We try to handle this in here in a some kind of a portable manner.
 *
 * We provide functions to read and write the memory version of packets
 * under the name get_X() and put_X().
 *
 * The USB I/O layer then takes care of CRC generation and byte swapping.
